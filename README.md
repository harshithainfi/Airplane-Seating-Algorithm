# Airplane-Seating-Algorithm
A Ruby program to arrange the seating for the Airline Passengers
A program that helps to allocate seats to the passengers in a flight based on the following input and rules.

Rules for seating:
1. Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back, starting from the left to
the right
2. Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center seats (any order in
center seats)

Input to the program will be:
1. A 2D array that represents the columns and rows - Ex. [[3,4], [4,5], [2,3], [3,4]]
2. Number of passengers waiting in the queue.

 The given Example has been implemented in (airline.rb)
Given - A 2D array that represents the columns and rows - [[3,2], [4,3], [2,3], [3,4]] 
(Please see the attached document - 'airline.rb' and input.txt)

If there were 30 passengers from then the seating output will be as in the attachment 'result.rb'

Below are the points to be noted:

The Algorithm used to successfully complete the programming challenge
The elegance of the code, modularity and readability
A VISUAL output that is printed (on the screen, in a console or exported to a file etc.) in way that is easy to read, identify the aisle, middle and window rows and has clear seating plan and passenger number.
Testability, TDD and test cases
